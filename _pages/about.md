Welcome! I'm currently a pre-doctoral research fellow at Harvard University for Professor David Yang. My research experience focuses on political economy and development, while my interest spans a wider spectrum. I'm familiar with topics on policy learning, China, migration, and intergenerational wealth persistence. Prior to joining Harvard, I worked as a part time research assistant in Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. I graduated in 2021 with an LL.B. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Peking University (北京大学).
